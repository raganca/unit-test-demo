# unit-test-demo

A VERY basic demonstration of unit testing.

- The demo library is a very basic C# class library, which gives us some code to test.
- The console app is not reallly meant to do anything but run and call the demo library.
- The tests are not exhaustive, but give us an idea of what unit tests might look like in a "real" project!
